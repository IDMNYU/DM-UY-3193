## Day 20

* Report back: final project ideas

* Quick lecture: Promises

* Databases with Firebase

    * [How to Firebase](https://howtofirebase.com/save-and-query-firebase-data-ed73fb8c6e3a)
        * Uses Promises, would make a great Learning Log
    
    * [What is Firebase?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6agS82Le9lLCBbeaW8inATT&v=JrHT1iqSrAQ)
        * Watching from 07:00-08:50
        
    * Useful Firebase documentation
        * [Saving data](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/admin/save-data)
        * [Credentials](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/admin/node/admin.credential#.cert)
        * [Tutorial using FB documentation: Set Up Firebase in 4 steps](https://hackernoon.com/nodejs-setup-firebase-in-4-step-tutorial-example-easy-beginner-service-account-key-json-node-server-d61e803d6cc8)
        
    * Demoing reading/writing to DB, integrating with Express
    
    * Bonus practice: [Saving p5.js Drawings to Firebase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUSvMxxm_Jo&index=4&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6agS82Le9lLCBbeaW8inATT)
    NOTE: This involves doing all the heavy lifting on the front end, and simply connecting to Firebase to save data, rather than our code-alongs, which utilize node.js
    
### Homework

* Assignment #9: Using Firebase
Option 1: Revisit Assignment #5, where you had to use the fs module to save login data to a JSON file. Rework your code to now save user login data to Firebase. You can optionally build in verifcation.

Option 2: Build a user login page that will be associated with your final project, and save login data to Firebase.

NOTE: It is not required you use Firebase for your final project, but if you plan to, this assignment can do double duty.

Submit your Github repo with a README on Github pages.

* Form a work plan and timeline for completion of your final projects. Next week will mostly be reserved for workshopping, collaborating, debugging, asking questions and getting help.
