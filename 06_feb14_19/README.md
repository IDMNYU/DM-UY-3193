### First Web App Project

You and your partner are going to create a jukebox. 

You will be building a music player that can play digital music files ( .mp3 or .wav ). Think about what functionality you might need for this to work. Encapsulate all of this functionality in a JavaScript object so that starting a song is as simple as calling Jukebox.play() You need an array of song objects and the ability to play, stop and pause a song. How would you switch songs? Can you shuffle songs? Focus on getting the JavaScript to work and keep the HTML/CSS minimal, make it work before you make it look good!

Before you Begin:

1) Read through [this tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content) describing how to use html5 audio and control playback using javascript.

2) Pseudo-code your approach

3) Draw out a basic wireframe for the visual aesthetic

Your JavaScript Jukebox should:

* Display at least one song on the page when the page loads

* Give the user the ability to load at least 5 different songs into the Jukebox besides the one that is loaded when the page initially renders

* The whole Jukebox should be backed by an object called Jukebox with methods to play, stop, and load songs.

Extra Challenges:

* Give the user the ability to play that song, without using the "built-in" play button. This could be through a different button, through clicking or mousing over an image on the page, or any other device of your choosing.

* Give the user the ability to stop that song without using the "built-in" stop button. Once again, this could be through a different button, through clicking or mousing over an image on the page, or any other device of your choosing.

* Playlist of songs, allows the user to queue up the next song

* Feature to request a random song

* Shuffle 

### Submission: 
 
* Push your code to one group member's Github repository. BOTH group members will need to submit the link on NYU Classes to receive credit.

* Make sure you include a descriptive README with your code

* Optional: Connect your repository to Github Pages, so it is live on the web. If you chose this option, please submit BOTH a direct link to your source code on Github in addition to the link to Github pages.
