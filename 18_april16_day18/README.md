### Homework

* Visit the [homework section](https://socket.io/get-started/chat) of the socket.io tutorial. Choose something from this section (or come up with your own idea) to level up your chat app that we began in class. You do not need to push this to Github, but have it completed and ready to demo on Thursday.

* Let's build something new with socket.io! The sky is the limit here. You can choose to build anything cool you imagine that involves back-and-forth communication between more than one user. This could be:
    
    * Build a collaborative drawing game, inspired by the tutorial but with your own twist
    
    * A picture or gif chat
    
    * A 2-player game
    
    * Anything else!
    
* Come in Thursday with an idea and a basic framework of how you will build. We will workshop your ideas in class on Thursday and present them in class the following Tuesday, April 23.
