## Day 16

* Check out my friend Zach's [new Twitterbot](https://twitter.com/trump_learned)

* Learning Log: Shehara

* Gallery walk: API apps

* 4 volunteers to walk through their code

* Writing data from the view to JSON

    * Example via [Jeremy Rivera](https://github.com/jeremy8rivera/dynwebapp_F18/tree/master/Assignment%205)

### Homework

* Read up on [Dan Phiffer](https://phiffer.org/), activist and developer at the ACLU, who will be joining us for a guest lecture on Thursday.

* Add a sign up page to your API app that requires user input that is written to a JSON file. (In this case, used as a miniature database.) You can decide what user input you require (name/email/password, email/password, etc.). As an added bonus, you could add a route that allows users to sign up then a second page that allows them to login, checking their information against what is written in the database.

Submit a link to a new Github directory, complete with a README, under Assignment #7 on NYU Classes.
