*Final self-assessment:*
Reflection is studying your own practice as seriously as you study anything. It involves thinking about why, what, and how you create something. In any learning situation you should study beforehand, make/do, reflect, adjust, and do it all over again. Learning happens in a cycle.

You have made it to the end of the semester! Think of where you began in September. What did you know? What did you hope to learn? Now revisit your midterm assessment to evaluate your progress from then until now. 

For your final project you will once again synthesis what you have noticed in your notes, assignments, projects, learning logs, and previous assessment with regard to your learning. Each self assessment should have a minimum of three citations. Write a narrative midterm self-evaluation that is a minimum of 2 paragraphs. (You certainly may write more.)

In this narrative, address the following:

    * What do I know about creating web applications right now?

    * What has my journey looked like?

    * How has my learning effected my understanding of what I can create with these tools? How has my learning effected what I may be inspired to create?
    
    * How do I expect to use what I learned in this class this semester?
    
Once you are finished:
    
    1) Copy/paste your text into the text box provided on the Final Assessment assignment on NYU Classes.
    
    2) Find someone to give you a high five because you finished the semester strong!
