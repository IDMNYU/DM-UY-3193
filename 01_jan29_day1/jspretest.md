This is just so we can assess the level of knowledge the class is coming in with, and adjust our pace accordingly - it's not for a grade! Please create a .js file that completes the following tasks:

 1) Create new variable called name and assign it a string with your name in it.

2) Write a function that takes a number, adds 2 to it, subtracts 5 from it, then returns a value.

3) Create a for loop that counts from 1 to 10.

4) The Age Calculator: Want to find out how old you'll be? Calculate it!

* Store your birth year in a variable.

* Store a future year in a variable.

* Calculate your 2 possible ages for that year based on the stored values.

* For example, if you were born in 1988, then in 2026 you'll be either 37 or 38, depending on what month it is in 2026.

* Output them to the console like so: "I will be either NN or NN in YYYY", substituting the values.

**In general, for this course, you should be entering with an understanding of how to create functionals, conditional statements and loops in Javascript to solve simple problems with numeric and text-based output.**
