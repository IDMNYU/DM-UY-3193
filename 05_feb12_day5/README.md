### Homework

You and your partner are going to create a jukebox over the next 2 days. 

You will be building a music player that can play digital music files ( .mp3 or .wav ). Think about what functionality you might need for this to work. Encapsulate all of this functionality in a JavaScript object so that starting a song is as simple as calling Jukebox.play() You need an array of song objects and the ability to play, stop and pause a song. How would you switch songs? Can you shuffle songs? Focus on getting the JavaScript to work and keep the HTML/CSS minimal, make it work before you make it look good!

Before you Begin:

1) Read through [this tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content) describing how to use html5 audio and control playback using javascript.

2) Pseudo-code your approach

3) Draw out a basic wireframe for the visual aesthetic

Your JavaScript Jukebox should:

Display at least one song on the page when the page loads
Give the user the ability to play that song, without using the "built-in" play button. This could be through a different button, through clicking or mousing over an image on the page, or any other device of your choosing.
Give the user the ability to stop that song without using the "built-in" stop button. Once again, this could be through a different button, through clicking or mousing over an image on the page, or any other device of your choosing.
Give the user the ability to load at least one different song into the Jukebox besides the one that is loaded when the page initially renders
The whole Jukebox should be backed by an object called Jukebox with methods to play, stop, and load songs.

Extra Challenge:

Playlist of songs, allows the user to queue up the next song
Feature to request a random song
