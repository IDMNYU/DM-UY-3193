### Homework

* Final project brainstorm! Write down at least 3 ideas of applications you'd like to build for your final project, and decide which you'd like to pursue. Talk with others in the class and/or use our Slack channel to communicate and decide if you'd like to work alone or team up with another classmate. Bring these ideas into class on Thursday.

* Are you missing any Learning Logs? Now is a great time to catch up or supplement any information you may need to complete your final project. 
    *RECOMMENDATION: Find a tutorial on Promises in Javascript in preparation for Thursday.
