## Day 19

* Round robin share: looking at socket.io apps

* Final projects are open

* Databases with Firebase

    * [How to Firebase](https://howtofirebase.com/save-and-query-firebase-data-ed73fb8c6e3a)
    
    * [What is Firebase?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6agS82Le9lLCBbeaW8inATT&v=JrHT1iqSrAQ)
    
    * Bonus practice: [Saving p5.js Drawings to Firebase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUSvMxxm_Jo&index=4&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6agS82Le9lLCBbeaW8inATT)
    NOTE: This involves doing all the heavy lifting on the front end, and simply connecting to Firebase to save data, rather than our code-alongs, which utilize node.js.


### Homework

* Final project brainstorm! Write down at least 3 ideas of applications you'd like to build for your final project, and decide which you'd like to pursue. Talk with others in the class and/or use our Slack channel to communicate and decide if you'd like to work alone or team up with another classmate.

* Are you missing any Learning Logs? Now is a great time to catch up or supplement any information you may need to complete your final project.
