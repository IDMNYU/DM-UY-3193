## Day 4

3-4 volunteers to show their word guesser game

More foundational JS:
* Double == vs triple === in conditionals

* JS objects: practice with instantiation 

* Easing into ES6
  * More on ```const``` vs ```let``` vs ```var```
  
* Quick note: submitting homework to NYU Classes
  
### Homework

* Make sure to submit the link to your Word Guesser Game v1 and your first self-assessment on NYU Classes

* Edit your Word Guesser/Hangman game to be object oriented and more advanced. For this assignment, please submit a link to your web-based text editor (repl, jsfiddle, etc). NYU Classes will have a grading breakdown for this assignment.
  
  * The game selects a random word from a word list and makes that the secret word
  
  * The player guesses one letter at a time, trying to figure out what the word is
  
  * If the player guesses correctly, any instances of that letter are revealed in the secret word
  
  * If the player guesses incorrectly, they are penalized by taking away a guess
  
  * If a player reveals all of the letters of the secret word, they win
  
  * If a player makes 8 incorrect guesses before solving the secret word, they lose

* Complete a Learning Log for this week if you haven't already. Suggestions:
  * Javascript objects
  * ES6 syntax
  * Javascript callback functions
