### Homework

* We will be building a mini Express app in class on Thursday. It will take in user input via a form, process it in your server-side JS file, and Express will route a response to a new view. 
This is a great time to do a Learning Log if any of these pieces are fuzzy. Do you need help with Express routing? Rendering the view? Working more with the Node File System?
