### Homework

* Do [this Shiffman tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Yyn-fBtGHfN0_xCtBwUkBp&v=6iZiqQZBQJY) on the node.js fs module

    * Once you understand how to use fs, set up a simple Express app that allows for the following:
    
        * Variable routes that save data to a JSON file

        * A route that allows the user to view the entire contents of the JSON file
        
        * Push your app to Github using a Gitignore file that ignores your node_modules, and submit the link to your repo via NYU Classes.

* Do the [Midterm self-assessment](https://github.com/IDMNYU/DM-UY-3193/blob/master/midtermselfassessment.md)
