## A note about this syllabus
This is a living document, as are the materials in this course repository. There are certain aspects of our course, such as our calendar or grading criteria, that will not differ from this syllabus unless there are extenuating circumstances. However, the pacing of this course may vary depending on student need, comprehension and technologies that are sometimes rapidly changing in the midst of our learning process. I will do everything in my power to update you on any changes ASAP (in class and via Slack) and to stay fully transparent about what you are expected to learn, produce, and share. Please engage in open communication, as I will do the same.

## Course Pre-requisites
Pre-requisite: DM-UY.2193, Intro to Web Development

## Course Description
In this course, students will bridge the gap between client and server, building dynamic web application front-ends powered by back-end servers. 

### Program Learning Objectives

**Students will:**

1 – Students will develop conceptual thinking skills to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.
	Students will develop a research and studio practice through inquiry and iteration.

2 – Students will develop technical skills to realize their ideas.
Students will understand and utilize tools and technology, while adapting to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn.
	Students will be able to integrate/interface different technologies within a technological ecosystem.

3 – Students will develop critical thinking skills that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.

4 – Students will gain knowledge of professional practices and organizations by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking, and career preparation.

5 – Students will develop collaboration skills to actively and effectively work in a team or group.

### Student Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1 - Design, build, and develop content for a web applications.

2 - Understand and implement the iterative process

3 - Learn how to proactively learn, also known as self-regulated learning. In any learning situation, you should study beforehand, make/do, debug, reflect, adjust, and do it all over again (iteration). Learning happens in a cycle.

4 - Create an internal developer / creative community


### Course Objectives


This course will reinforce or introduce students to:
* Dynamic front-end development using Javascript

* Server application development to support a web front-end

* version control through git and github

* current content management system platforms 

This course will help students to:
* understand application development process from conception to launch

* develop a vocabulary to evaluate and critique web applications


### Course Structure

Class time will be spent as a combination of lecture, review, and in class exercises. Homework will consist of online tutorials as well as weekly projects that build on each week’s topics of discussion.

#### Readings

There is no required textbook for this course, however students will be required to complete various online tutorials between classes.

#### Laptop Usage During Class

I love having WiFi available and I think it is a valuable tool for use in the classroom. Unfortunately, it can very easily be a distraction as well. Laptop use will be expected in class but should be focused on class-specific material, applications, and research. Whenever classmates or guests are presenting please keep your laptop closed. The quality of the class depends in large part on your attention and active participation, so please respect your fellow classmates and close your lid.

## Grading

NOTE: While you are expected to document and host your work on Github or another external server, links to assignments, projects, and documentation will be submitted and graded on NYU Classes. This will allow me a space to privately communicate any notes and point deductions connected to each student's assignment. It will also allow you to track your progress in the class. After midterm and final presentations, grades from the NYU Classes gradebook will be migrated to Albert.

Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:

**Regular Assignments 25%**

We will have weekly assignments that are relevant to material from the previous class. When it is assigned, each assignment will contain a breakdown of how many points it is worth and the grading criteria. Most assignments will include a Learning Log, where you will be asked to provide some assessment of your clarity on a topic after doing a tutorial. Please refer to the Learning Logs file in this repository for more instructions. Late assignments will lose a point for each day they are late.

**Mid-Term Project 20%**

The midterm assignment will be a project that demonstrates a working knowledge server-side programming. This project must be completed, published, and presented.

**Participation and Attendance 20%**

Attendance is *mandatory*. Please inform me via Slack direct message if you are going to miss a class. Showing up late for class or an excessive number of absences will adversely affect your grade. This class will be participatory, you are expected to participate in discussions and give feedback to other students both in class and participate with their projects. This (along with attendance) is 20% of your overall grade. Each student will be asked to do a 5-min presentation on a Learning Log throughout the semester, which is part of your participation grade.

**PLEASE NOTE: 3 unexcused absences will result in your grade dropping 5%**

If you need a medical absence excused, you must submit documentation to Deanna Rayment - deanna.rayment@nyu.edu - for the absence to be reviewed and considered excused.

**Final Project 20%**

Class will culminate with final projects. It is expected that these will be both technology and content driven. The final project will be built over the course of several weeks. This project must be completed, published, and presented.

**Documentation/Self-Asssessments/Tickets to Leave 15%**

5% - Students will be expected to document their work on Github. You may also set up a blog on a site like Wordpress or Medium for supplementary narrative documentation. If you already have your own hosted website and would like to blog there, that works, too. Github documentation will be expected to be coupled with comprehensive comments in your code and a thorough README file with each repository.

5% - At the end of each session, students will need to submit a Ticket to Leave. Please view the Ticket to Leave file in this repo for specific instructions.

5% - Students will perform three self assessments on their work throughout the semester. Specific instructions and deadlines on these assessments will be provided when they are assigned.

## Qualitative Grading Overview

Each student will be judged on the quality, experimentation, and improvement that their work shows.

### A. Excellent (90-100)

Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been of the highest level, showing sustained excellence in meeting course responsibilities. Work clearly differentiates itself from other work, has memorable impact, pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond what is discussed in class. The student thoroughly understands the web design and development process.

### B. Very Good / Good (80-89)

Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been good, though not of the highest level. Work demonstrates a better than average web design and development process.

### C. Satisfactory (70-79)

Performance and attendance of the student has been adequate, satisfactorily meeting the course requirements. Work is average and competent, showing a basic understanding of the web design and development process.

### D. Poor; Below Average (60-69)

Performance and attendance of the student has been less than adequate. Work is lacking in many or most areas that show any understanding of visual foundation. Problems may include lack of interest, procrastination, poor planning and poor craft.

### F. Unacceptable (59 & Below)

Performance and attendance of the student has been such that course requirements have not been met. Work shows no overall understanding of the course material on many levels or either a severe lack of interest.
