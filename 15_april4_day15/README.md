## Day 15

* Learning Logs: Luvneesh & Shahriar

* Using forms to pass data from the view to the server

* Building a simple weather app

    * Your goal: Use the Open Weather API to create a simple app that allows the user to enter a city into a text box and get the weather for that city in return.
    
    * [Step 1](https://codeburst.io/build-a-simple-weather-app-with-node-js-in-just-16-lines-of-code-32261690901d)
    
    * [Step 2](https://codeburst.io/build-a-weather-website-in-30-minutes-with-node-js-express-openweather-a317f904897b)
    
    * OPTIONS: 
    
        * Walk through the process step-by-step using the Codeburst tutorial
        
        * Or, if you'd rather take your own route, create your own version of this app
        
        * You can use the view engine of your choice. The tutorial will utlize EJS. You are welcome to make this work with Pug or Handlebars if you'd rather.
        
### Homework

Now it's your turn! 

Using the API of your choice, build a lightweight Express app that allows for user input that retrieves data from the API. (Example: Our weather app that allowed the user to type in the name of a city into a form and retrieve the weather for that city.)

Push your app to Github with a README that tells the user step-by-step how to install and run the app locally. Make sure your app includes a .gitignore file that ignores your node_modules and config file (if you have one). DO NOT PUSH CODE THAT INCLUDES YOUR API KEY!

Submit a link to your repo on NYU Classes under Assignment #6.
